        <p>Arizona is a beautifu state. it is the home of The Grand Canyon, a very popular destination that offers beautiful landscapes.
           There is nothing compared with its colorful sunsets, red rocks, vivrant cities, sunny skies, and low humidity.
           Also popular for its tall palm trees and the iconic sahuaro cactus. Arizona is the state that remains on Mountain
           Standard Time all year. As for temperature, it can be very hot -deadly hot- but during the spring you can enjoy
           cool nights and moderate heat.
